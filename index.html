      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is an
      independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the
      civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. NASA was
      established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for
      Aeronautics (NACA), to give the U.S. space development effort a distinctly
      civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space
      science.[5][6][7] NASA has since led most American space exploration,
      including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968-1972 Apollo Moon
      landing missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. NASA
      supports the International Space Station and oversees the development of
      the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the crewed lunar
      Artemis program, Commercial Crew spacecraft, and the planned Lunar Gateway
      space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services
      Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown
      management for uncrewed NASA launches. NASA's science is focused on better
      understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;[8] advancing
      heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's
      Heliophysics Research Program;[9] exploring bodies throughout the Solar
      System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons and planetary
      rovers such as Perseverance;[10] and researching astrophysics topics, such
      as the Big Bang, through the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Great
      Observatories and associated programs.

    histoy of NASA
    <p>
      Beginning in 1946, the National Advisorry Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)
      began experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell
      X-1.[43] In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial
      satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958). An effort
      for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet space
      program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on
      October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own
      fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat
      to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik
      crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower
      counseled more deliberate measures. The result was a consensus that the
      White House forged among key interest groups, including scientists
      committed to basic research; the Pentagon which had to match the Soviet
      military achievement; corporate America looking for new business; and a
      strong new trend in public opinion looking up to space exploration.[44]

      Past administrators Further information: Administrator of NASA NASA's
      first administrator was Dr. T. Keith Glennan who was appointed by
      President Dwight D. Eisenhower. During his term (1958–1961) he brought
      together the disparate projects in American space development
      research.[51] James Webb led the agency during the development of the
      Apollo program in the 1960s.[52] James C. Fletcher has held the position
      twice; first during the Nixon administration in the 1970s and then at the
      request of Ronald Reagan following the Challenger disaster.[53] Daniel
      Goldin held the post for nearly 10 years and is the longest serving
      administrator to date. He is best known for pioneering the "faster,
      better, cheaper" approach to space programs.[54] Bill Nelson is currently
      serving as the 14th administrator of NASA.
