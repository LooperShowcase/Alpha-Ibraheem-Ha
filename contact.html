      NASA’s future will continue to be a story of human exploration,
      technology, and science. We will go back to the Moon to learn more about
      what it will take to support human exploration to Mars and beyond. We will
      continue to nurture the development of a vibrant low-Earth orbit economy
      that builds on the work done to date by the International Space Station.
      NASA engineers will develop new technologies to improve air transport at
      home and meet the challenges of advanced space exploration. Our scientists
      will work to increase an understanding of our planet and our place in the
      universe. We will continue to try to answer the question, “Are we alone?”
      Unlike the way the space program started, NASA will not be racing a
      competitor. Rather, we will build upon the community of industrial,
      international, and academic partnerships forged for the space station.
      Commercial companies will play an increasing role in the space industry:
      launching rockets and satellites, transporting cargo and crew, building
      infrastructure in low-Earth orbit. NASA will continue to be a global
      leader in scientific discovery, fostering opportunities to turn new
      knowledge into things that improve life here on Earth.

      In the half-century since people visited the Moon, NASA has continued to
      push the boundaries of knowledge to deliver on the promise of American
      ingenuity and leadership in space. And NASA will continue that work by
      moving forward to the Moon with astronauts landing on the lunar South Pole
      by 2024. NASA is implementing the President’s Space Policy Directive-1 to
      “lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial
      and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar
      system.” NASA stands on the verge of commercializing low-Earth orbit.
      These experiences and partnerships will enable NASA to go back to the Moon
      in 2024 – this time to stay. NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration is
      the biggest rocket ever built, the Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion
      spacecraft and the Gateway lunar command module. With its partners, NASA
      will use the Gateway lunar command module orbiting the Moon as a staging
      point for missions that allow astronauts to explore more parts of the
      lunar surface than ever before
