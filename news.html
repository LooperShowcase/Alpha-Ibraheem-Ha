      <p>  Members of the media and public are invited to participate in NASA’s imaginAviation, a free, virtual event focusing on how the agency transforms research innovations into new possibilities for aviation for the benefit of humanity. Sessions run from Tuesday, Feb. 28, to Thursday, March 2.

A full agenda for the workshop is online.

Registered members will have access to view presentations about NASA’s efforts to transform aviation in ways that increase sustainability and air transportation options, as well as gain insight into technologies in development by NASA and its partners.

Speakers include:

NASA Associate Administrator Bob Cabana
Robert Pearce, associate administrator, NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD)
Barbara Esker, assistant deputy association administrator for Missions, ARMD
Robbie Cabral, inventor
Trisha Pesiri, former Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller and wildland fire survivor
Sessions will cover some of NASA’s high-priority missions and projects, including sustainable aviation and the Quesst mission, which seeks to enable quiet supersonic flight over land using its experimental X-59 aircraft for testing. NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility efforts to develop new air transportation systems for people and cargo in underserved areas are another topic on the agenda.

NASA’s imaginAviation is presented by the agency’s Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program. For more information on the event or to register, visit:
